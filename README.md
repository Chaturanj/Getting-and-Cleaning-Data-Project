# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

In this project, data will be downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones, transformed and a new tidy data file will be generated.

The R script called run_analysis.R does the following:

1. Loads the data
2. Cleans the data
3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
5. Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

The file CodeBook.md contains information about the project, the data transformations perfomed and variables.

The file tidyDataFunctions.txt is the final tidy data set containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
