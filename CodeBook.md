# Data Set Information

The source data was collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, below is a decription of the data set:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

# Before running the script run_analysis.R do the following:
1. Download the data set from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Unzip the data set into your working directory
3. This code require the library(data.table)

# The run_analysis.R does the following:
1. Loads test and training data sets into data frames
2. Loads activity data and adds column names
3. Loads features data and adds column names  
4. Removes "_" from the column activityName from the file activity
5. Gathers the featuresCode for the mean and standard deviation
4. Merges test and training data frames 
5. Filters the data frames to only include the mean and standard deviation variables
6. Produced the file tidyData.txt
7. Applied the mean and standard deviation calculations across the groups
8. Produced tidyDataFunctions.txt to group the tidyData.txt by subject and activity

# Variables

subjectCode: 1 to 30 each representing a participant in the study
activity: the activity that the subject was doing at the time of the measurement
